# github-client-mdl
Github Client Built with React + Redux + Material Design

## Getting Started

You have configuration-free dev experience with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Clone the repository to get started and run `yarn install`

```sh
git clone git@github.com:oPauloChaves/github-client-mdl.git
cd github-client-mdl
yarn install
```

## Developing

To run/test the app, type:

```sh
cd github-client-mdl
yarn start
```

> The above command runs your app in development mode and starts the [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). 
To see it in your browser go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

To build the app for production, run:

```
cd github-client-mdl
yarn run build
```
